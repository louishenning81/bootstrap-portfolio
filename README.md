# bootstrap-portfolio

I'm getting better but I'm still struggling with a couple things:
1. I'm not great at altering bootstrap components
2. There are still times where I'm not entirely certain where bootstrap ends and CSS should begin

Other than that, I did find the bootstrap assignment quite a bit more challenging than the responsive assignment largely because altering the bootstrap components to replicate the original site was so challenging.  

In the event, I was building a site from scratch I could see how bootstrap could be a HUGE timesaver.  While you do risk the possiblity of your site looking very similar to others in using it, I think the ability to pick and choose components where needed could be super userful.
